## Project Description

We must allow users to log in and upload a CSV of their playlist and have it displayed on the dashboard.

Requirements:

1. A project must have a log file with an entry for each time a user uploads a CSV playlist. 
2. There must be a test to verify that the CSV file is uploaded and processed
3. We must create a database record that is related to the user record for each song in the playlist.  We only need to store the song's title, artist, year, and genre. 
4. We must have a test for login, a test for registration, a test for accessing the dashboard as a logged-in user, and a test for denying access to the dashboard, and denying access to uploading the CSV file

5. Write a log message for each request and response that records the method, route, time, request address.
