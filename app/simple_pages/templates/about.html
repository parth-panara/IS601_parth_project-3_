    <strong>A</strong> song is a musical composition intended to be performed by the human voice. This is often done at
    distinct and
    fixed pitches (melodies) using patterns of sound and silence. Songs contain various forms, such as those including
    the repetition and variation of sections.

    Written words created specifically for music, or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a
    pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated
    pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs composed in a simple
    style that are learned informally "by ear" are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for
    professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These
    songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers, and lyricists. Art songs
    are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and
    recorded on audio or video (or, in some cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may
    also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas, films, and TV shows.

    A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble
    involving more voices singing in harmony, although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal
    forms including opera and oratorio, which use terms such as aria and recitative instead.[1] A song can be sung
    without accompaniment by instrumentalists (a cappella) or accompanied by instruments. In popular music, a singer may
    perform with an acoustic guitarist, pianist, organist, accordionist, or a backing band. In jazz, a singer may
    perform with a single pianist, a small combo (such as a trio or quartet), or with a big band. A Classical singer may
    perform with a single pianist, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. In jazz and blues, singers often learn songs "by
    ear" and they may improvise some melody lines. In Classical music, melodies are written by composers in sheet music
    format, so singers learn to read music.
